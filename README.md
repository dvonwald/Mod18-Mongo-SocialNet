# NoSQL Challenge - Social Network API (Mongo SocialNet)

## Description

This project is the models, routes, controllers for a NoSQL MongoDB Social Media application using Mongoose. This was to learn about Mongoose, NoSQL, and how to get Collections and Documents to interact with one another. I learned a lot about MongoDB, Mongoose, and the many methods that are available in Mongoose, as well as expanded my knowledge on routes and modularization. Learning mongoose Schemas and Models was great. I really enjoyed doing this. Unfortunately there is still a few features I would like to add in the near future that I did not get to yet.

## Installation

Clone the github repo onto your device, then open up a terminal in that directory and type "node index" and hit enter. This will launch the server. There is a video walkthrough showing the part following having the github repo on your computer.

## Usage

Here are several videos demonstrating how to use the application with Insomnia. You must use the routes and methods detailed in the routes folder files, and provide the information required in the schemas in the models folder.
